# Data_Structure-linked-list_project
# Milestone 1: Implemintation of the data structure for the program 
A C++ Singlyâ€‘Linked List Implementation for the Stack

# Author: Mariam Nousseir (ID: 900182741) did the following: 

create the Repository  and did Structure with all files 
include/LinkedList.h :header file containing the definition of the LinkedList class and its nested Node class.
src/linkedlist.cpp:file conatining the implementation of each function.
src/main.cpp ; file containing test cases for the functions. 

Functions I implemented:
Constructor & Destructor:
LinkedList()
~LinkedList()
Capacity & Status:
bool isEmpty() const
bool isFull() const
int getLength() const
Data Manipulation:
const std::string& getDataAt(int index) const
int search(const char* value) const
Utilities:
void printList() const
void removeDuplicates()
void makeCircular()

Test Cases & Expected Output:

Test 1: Check if the list is empty initially Expected Output:
Is list empty? Yes

Test 2: Inserting tokens at the end of the list Expected Output:
List after insertions: 5 + ( 3 * 3 )

Test 3: Getting the length of the list Expected Output:
Length of list: 7

Test 4: Retrieve data at index 3 Expected Output:
Data at index 3: 3

Test 5: Searching for the first occurrence of the token '+' Expected Output:
Token '+' found at index: 1

Test 6: Removing duplicate tokens Expected Output:
List after removing duplicates: 5 + ( 3 * )
Length after removing duplicates: 5

Test 7: Making the list circular Expected Output:
List after converting to circular: 5 + ( 3 * 3 )

Test 8: Check if the list is full Expected Output:
Is list full? No

Test 9: Retrieve data at an out-of-bounds index (index 100) Expected Output:
Correctly handled out of bounds request
